How are you doing today?

(Test Case 2)
She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but her mom had insisted that she go. She's resisted at first, but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go. Mom tended to be that way. She would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted. 

So, here she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called.
This is important to remember. Love isn't like pie. You don't need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones. 

No matter how much love you give, you can always give more. It doesn't run out, so don't try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out. 
Give it freely and as much as you want.
