I am just going to list down my questions for you:
How's life?

Do we have a car, house ?
Are we finally enjoying our work?

(Just a reminder to call them if you haven't recently)
I don't know lagna jhalay ki nahi tumcha, but who did you end up marrying? Love or Arranged? (is it gauri? heheh)
Have you found someone beautifully charismatic to share your life with? Who's the lucky girl?
I hope KRISHNA is still with us, don't ever forget about him.
Did we visit JAPAN?

If we did achieve most of this, then CONGRATULATIONS SIR! HAT'S OFF!! I'M FUCKING PROUD!!!
All those years  of sacrifies have finally paid off.

Glad to know that we finally did it.

AND even if we didn't, don't stress if you didn't achieve most of the above mentioned things. All I wanted to know is that I hope that we are HAPPY, that's all! Because right now life is bit stressful and difficult for me.

Thanks & regards,
Siddhesh Sawant (Age: 22)
